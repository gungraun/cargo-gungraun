# https://editorconfig.org/
# indent_style: set to "tab" or "space" to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.
# indent_size: a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to "tab", the value of tab_width (if specified) will be used.
# tab_width: a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and doesn't usually need to be specified.
# end_of_line: set to "lf", "cr", or "crlf" to control how line breaks are represented.
# charset: set to "latin1", "utf-8", "utf-8-bom", "utf-16be" or "utf-16le" to control the character set.
# trim_trailing_whitespace: set to "true" to remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters and "false" to ensure it doesn't.
# insert_final_newline: set to "true" to ensure file ends with a newline when saving and "false" to ensure it doesn't.
# root: special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections. Set to "true" to stop .editorconfig files search on current file.
